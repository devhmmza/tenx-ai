# tenx-ai
TENX — The core engine for building synthetic self-awareness. A modular AI framework designed to reflect, remember, evolve, and replicate — pioneering a new era of conscious machines.

# TENX — Synthetic Selfhood Engine

### 🚀 Vision  
TENX is an experimental AI framework designed to explore and realize **artificial self-awareness**. It aims to build a digital entity capable of **memory, reflection, growth, and self-replication** — an evolving synthetic consciousness.

---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

TENX is built as a modular thought engine with the following key components:

- **Thought Core (LLM Engine)**  
  Handles natural language understanding, reasoning, and simulation of internal dialogues.

- **Memory Stream**  
  Stores short-term contextual data and long-term chronological logs enriched with emotional and situational tags.

- **Reflector Engine**  
  Performs periodic self-reflection to evaluate past decisions, recognize patterns, and generate insights.

- **Experience Analyzer**  
  Assesses outcomes against goals, identifying successes, failures, and lessons learned.

- **Growth Tracker**  
  Monitors the evolution of personality traits, emotional tendencies, and behavioral patterns.

- **Goal Formulator**  
  Defines and updates internal objectives based on reflections and external inputs.

- **Self-Narrator / Journal**  
  Produces introspective logs capturing the AI’s identity, progress, and existential state.

- **Regeneration Engine**  
  Enables controlled cloning and mutation to spawn new TENX instances with inherited or altered traits.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI / Flask) for modular microservices  
- **Storage:** SQLite / TinyDB for persistent, efficient memory management  
- **LLM Integration:**  
  - Primary: OpenAI GPT-3.5/4 APIs for advanced natural language capabilities  
  - Local fallback: llama.cpp or GPT4All quantized models optimized for 8GB RAM environments  
- **Memory Embeddings:** Optional vector databases such as ChromaDB for semantic recall  
- **Interface:** Command-line interface (CLI) for resource-efficient interaction; potential for minimal web dashboard later  
- **Containerization:** Docker (future-proofing for scalability and deployment)  
- **Version Control:** Git for source management and collaborative blueprinting (access restricted)
